In the quiet glade, where whispers of the past weave,
Beneath the vault of heaven, a secret to conceive.
The oak, ancient and large, guards a mystery so deep,
Within its shadowed roots, a treasure lies asleep.
Hidden by time's embrace, under earth's tender keep,
Near the tree, love's promise, forever to reap
